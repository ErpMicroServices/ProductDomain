Feature: BDD/Cucumber Test Framework Setup
  As a developer
  I want a comprehensive BDD testing framework
  So that I can write behavior-driven tests for ProductDomain functionality

  Background:
    Given the ProductDomain project is set up
    And Gradle build system is configured

  Scenario: Cucumber dependencies are properly configured
    Given I check the build configuration
    Then all modules should have Cucumber dependencies
    And the versions should be consistent across modules
    And Cucumber should integrate with JUnit 5

  Scenario: Feature file structure is organized
    Given I check the test resources directory
    Then there should be a features directory structure
    And feature files should be organized by domain
    And each feature should follow Gherkin best practices

  Scenario: Step definitions framework is established
    Given I check the test source directory
    Then there should be a steps package structure
    And step definitions should be organized by feature
    And common steps should be in a shared package
    And Spring integration should be configured

  Scenario: Test runners are configured for all modules
    Given I check the test runner configuration
    Then each module should have a Cucumber test runner
    And runners should use JUnit Platform Suite
    And runners should specify glue code locations
    And runners should configure report generation

  Scenario: Test data management is implemented
    Given I check the test utilities
    Then there should be test data factories
    And database cleanup utilities should exist
    And test fixtures should be available
    And test data should be isolated per scenario

  Scenario: Test reporting is configured
    Given I run the Cucumber tests
    Then HTML reports should be generated
    And JSON reports should be generated
    And reports should include screenshots on failure
    And reports should be aggregated across modules

  Scenario: Parallel execution is enabled
    Given I check the test configuration
    Then parallel execution should be configurable
    And thread count should be adjustable
    And tests should be thread-safe
    And database isolation should be maintained

  Scenario: CI/CD integration is configured
    Given I check the CI configuration
    Then Cucumber tests should run in CI pipeline
    And test reports should be published
    And failures should block the build
    And performance metrics should be tracked

  Scenario: Sample product management features exist
    Given I check the sample features
    Then there should be product CRUD feature files
    And category management features should exist
    And inventory tracking features should exist
    And pricing features should exist
    And each feature should have complete scenarios
